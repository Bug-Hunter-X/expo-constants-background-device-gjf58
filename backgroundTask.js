This error typically occurs when you're using Expo's `Constants.deviceName` or similar APIs within a background task or service worker.  These APIs are designed to access device information within the main application context and may not be available when running in a detached context, like a background service.  The solution involves ensuring that the code that depends on `Constants.deviceName` (and other sensitive device info) is not run outside the main application thread or using environment variables that can be set prior to launching the background process.
